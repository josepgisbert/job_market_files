Welcome to my GitHub Repository! My name is Josep Gisbert, and I am a PhD candidate at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona.

In my research I use econometrics and data science methods to uncover causal relationships in the fields of Banking, Fintech, and Social Finance. During my Ph.D., I've also received training in financial decision making and artifcial intelligence (both reinforcement learning and deep learning approaches). I love teaching finance, business analytics and econometrics courses.

I am currently on the job market and will be available for interviews at the virtual EEA meeting in December 2021 and the virtual ASSA meeting in January 2022.
